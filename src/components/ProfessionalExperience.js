            In my recent role, I actively contributed to the development of an
            asset management application. I played a key role in testing and
            resolving bugs across both the front-end and back-end components of
            the system. The application was developed using React for the
            front-end and Java Spring Boot for the back-end, ensuring a robust
            and efficient system architecture.
